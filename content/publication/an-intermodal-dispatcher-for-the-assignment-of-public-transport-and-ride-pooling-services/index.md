abstract: This paper describes the components of an intermodal dispatcher of
  ride pooling requests to integrate these urban mobility systems with the
  public transport network in an urban area, thus making possible a new
  intermodal system. The intermodal dispatcher makes use of a prior dispatcher,
  developed exclusively for conventional ride pooling systems and a method that
  filters out the requests that have few possibilities of being served using the
  public transport system, leaving them to be served directly by ride pooling
  vehicles. The assignments of customers to vehicles of the ride pooling system
  are finally determined by an integer programming model of reduced dimensions,
  so that it can be solved efficiently by conventional solvers as shown in the
  preliminary computational results included in the paper.
