abstract = {This paper describes the components of an intermodal dispatcher of ride pooling requests to integrate these urban mobility systems with the public transport network in an urban area, thus making possible a new intermodal system. The intermodal dispatcher makes use of a prior dispatcher, developed exclusively for conventional ride pooling systems and a method that filters out the requests that have few possibilities of being served using the public transport system, leaving them to be served directly by ride pooling vehicles. The assignments of customers to vehicles of the ride pooling system are finally determined by an integer programming model of reduced dimensions, so that it can be solved efficiently by conventional solvers as shown in the preliminary computational results included in the paper.}
