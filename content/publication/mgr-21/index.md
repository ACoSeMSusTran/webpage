abstract: The success of machine-learning methods is spreading their use to many different
  fields. This paper analyses one of these methods, the Kernel Logistic Regression
  (KLR), from the point of view of Random Utility Model (RUM) and proposes the use
  of the KLR to specify the utilities in RUM, freeing the modeler from the need to
  postulate a functional relation between the features. A Monte Carlo simulation study
  is conducted to empirically compare KLR with the Multinomial Logit (MNL) method,
  the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Random Forests (RF). We have shown that,
  using simulated data, KLR is the only method that achieves maximum accuracy and
  leads to an unbiased willingness-to-pay estimator for non-linear phenomena. In a
  real travel mode choice problem, RF achieved the highest predictive accuracy, followed
  by KLR. However, KLR allows for the calculation of indicators such as the value
  of time, which is of great importance in the context of transportation.
