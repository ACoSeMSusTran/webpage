abstract: The success of machine-learning methods is spreading their use to many
  different fields. This paper analyses one of these methods, the Kernel
  Logistic Regression (KLR), from the point of view of Random Utility Model
  (RUM) and proposes the use of the KLR to specify the utilities in RUM, freeing
  the modeler from the need to postulate a functional relation between the
  features. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to empirically compare
  KLR with the Multinomial Logit (MNL) method, the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  and the Random Forests (RF). We have shown that, using simulated data, KLR is
  the only method that achieves maximum accuracy and leads to an unbiased
  willingness-to-pay estimator for non-linear phenomena. In a real travel mode
  choice problem, RF achieved the highest predictive accuracy, followed by KLR.
  However, KLR allows for the calculation of indicators such as the value of
  time, which is of great importance in the context of transportation.
