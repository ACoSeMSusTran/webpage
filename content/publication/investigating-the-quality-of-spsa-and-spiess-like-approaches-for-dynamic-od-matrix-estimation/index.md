abstract: Since OD matrices are not directly observable, indirect procedures
  have been developed to estimate OD matrices from traffic data. Traffic
  management must move toward dynamic traffic assignment models because they
  capture congestion propagation effects. In this context, dynamic OD matrices
  are needed. This paper first explores the extension of a conventional bilevel
  analytical static method to the dynamic context, then analyses the solutions
  obtained regarding both convergence to measured traffic data and structural
  similarity to an a priori OD matrix. A simulation optimization technique,
  SPSA, is then proposed because its flexibility allows inclusion of traffic
  counts (as in Spiess method) and emerging ICT traffic measurements. The
  performances of these two types of algorithms are analyzed in detail,
  focussing on faults of classical convergence measures to obtain an estimated
  dynamic OD matrix structurally similarity to the a priori OD matrix and pros
  and cons of variants of selected methods.
