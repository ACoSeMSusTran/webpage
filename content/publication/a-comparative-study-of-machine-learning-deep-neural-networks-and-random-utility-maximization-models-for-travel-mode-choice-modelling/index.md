abstract: Traditionally, Random Utility Maximization (RUM) models have been
  widely applied to travel mode choice modelling. Currently, Machine Learning
  (ML) models are being applied as an alternative to RUM models, since they
  provide better results in terms of prediction capability and they can manage
  large volumes of data. In this paper, a comprehensive comparison between
  classic RUM models and ML models, including single and ensemble classifiers as
  well as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), is provided in order to assess
  systematically the performance of different models over two different datasets
  which have different sizes and nature of data. Numerical experiments show
  Random Forest (RF) is the best classifier in terms of accuracy index and the
  computational cost to train the model.
