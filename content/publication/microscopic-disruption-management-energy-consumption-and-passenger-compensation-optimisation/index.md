abstract: Rail operations are often disrupted by accidents that cause traffic to
  diverge from the scheduled operations, rendering it difficult to run the
  schedule as planned. In such a case, the operator must change the schedule to
  return to the original schedule. If passengers are delayed, a train operator
  may have a policy of economically compensating them (e.g., refunding ticket
  fare). Compensation amounts are usually determined by the length of the delay.
  As a result, it is critical to have a smart way of determining whether to
  accelerate trains to absorb delays, thus increasing energy usage, or to
  compensate passengers. This paper presents a mathematical model for
  determining the speed profile while taking passenger usage into account. The
  model determines the best sequence of operating regimes and switching points
  between them for a variety of different situations and train types, all while
  accounting for delays and passenger compensation policies. The aim is to
  reduce both the amount of energy consumed and the amount of compensation paid
  to passengers. There are constraints on traction and braking forces, train
  velocity, forces induced by vertical and horizontal track profile, and
  passenger compensation policy. The results of computational tests performed on
  practical problem instances of the Spanish rail operator RENFE are showed. The
  suggested approach is capable of producing strategies that strike an excellent
  balance between different managerial objectives.
