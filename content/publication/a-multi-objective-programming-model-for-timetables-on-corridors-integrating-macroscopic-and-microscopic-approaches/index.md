abstract: This paper proposes an integrated framework for timetable design that
  meets the needs of service planners, who usually adopt a purely macroscopic
  point of view toward the demand requirements and conflicts that these
  timetables may cause at stations due to their particular configurations and
  structures. Service planners may not take these aspects into account, which
  require a microscopic analysis of the structure of the stations, considering
  possible conflicts at platforms and/or internal junctions. To this end, the
  proposed integrated model guarantees feasible timetables while balancing
  performance indexes for the interests of passengers and operators. Specified
  bounds are maintained for the differences between service planners optimal
  timetables and those that are operational at stations. The resulting problem
  is modeled as a multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem. The
  model can be solved with sufficient accuracy and in a reasonable amount of
  computing time, as shown by tests on the Madrid-Zaragoza-Barcelona high speed
  railway network. In this case, we perform a Pareto frontier analysis and find
  that the problem is well-posed. In addition, the previous model forms the
  basis of a heuristic procedure for obtaining timetables that avoid, as much as
  possible, conflicts and concentrations of arrivals/departures at/from
  stations, thus allowing for improved timetable recoverability and robustness
  in case of unexpected disruptions.
