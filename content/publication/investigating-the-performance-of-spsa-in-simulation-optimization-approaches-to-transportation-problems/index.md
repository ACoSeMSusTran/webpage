abstract: "While optimization models play a key role in transportation analysis,
  the objective function to be optimized, however, cannot be defined
  analytically. It is therefore necessary to resort to non-differentiable
  optimization methods that usually pivot on evaluating the objective function.
  Special cases of particular interest are those in Dynamic OD Estimation, which
  cannot evaluate the objective function analytically and thus the formulation
  falls in the computational framework of Simulation-Optimization. SPSA is not
  limited to the inputs from conventional traffic counts and can be easily
  extended to account for the measurements of traffic variables supplied by
  emerging sensors exploiting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).
  Numerical experiments have been conducted, and the results have been analyzed
  from two different perspectives: performance and solution quality. This allows
  understanding the behavior of the SPSA algorithm and new variants, which
  altogether contribute to the aim of adding ICT measures in the future. Their
  sensitivity to the initial values, the effect of bounding the variables and
  scaling techniques are analyzed. This paper will report on the results of the
  numerical experiments, their analyses, conclusions and further research."
