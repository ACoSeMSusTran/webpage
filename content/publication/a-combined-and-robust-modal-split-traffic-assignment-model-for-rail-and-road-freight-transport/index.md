abstract: Searching for achieving an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas
  emissions, the EU has set as a goal a modal shift in freight transport of 30%
  by rail for the near future. In this context, it is vital to use modal choice
  models road versus rail to assess the shippers’ acceptance of the actions
  promoting the use of rail. This paper develops a combined model for jointly
  evaluating modal split and railway freight flows, addressed to the case when a
  modal split based on a random utility model is available, and some of its
  coefficients may present a non-negligible variability. To this end, after the
  initial deterministic formulation a robust counterpart of the model is
  developed. The model, formulated as a non-linear integer programming problem,
  is oriented to a multi-carrier environment and includes constraints to
  consider the interactions between the different types of flows on the railway
  network, allowing a good evaluation of the cost types of the carriers and the
  network capacity. An algorithmic solution based on the outer approximation
  method is shown to provide accurate solutions in a reasonable computational
  time for the robust and non-robust versions of the model. Examples centered on
  a section of the Trans-European Transport Network, the TEN-T Core network
  corridors, are reported to test the model’s applicability. Results show that
  this model can be a helpful tool for analyzing the possible shippers’ response
  to the different railway carriers’ services competing with the road.
