abstract = {Abstract:
Rapid transit network design is highly dependent on the future system usage. These spatially distributed systems are vulnerable to disruptions: during daily operations different incidents may occur. Despite the unpredictable nature of them, effective mitigation methods from an engineering perspective should be designed. In this paper, we present several risk averse measures for risk reduction in the rapid transit network design problem based on a set of finite scenarios to represent the disruptions’ uncertainty. As a counter-parts of the typical risk neutral strategy, some measures that are presented are aiming to minimizing the impacts of the worst scenario in the network operation, and another additionally, takes into account different risk reduction profiles. Some computational experience is presented.}
