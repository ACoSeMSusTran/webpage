abstract: "Rapid transit network design is highly dependent on the future system
  usage. These spatially distributed systems are vulnerable to disruptions:
  during daily operations different incidents may occur. Despite the
  unpredictable nature of them, effective mitigation methods from an engineering
  perspective should be designed. In this paper, we present several risk averse
  measures for risk reduction in the rapid transit network design problem based
  on a set of finite scenarios to represent the disruptions’ uncertainty. As a
  counter-parts of the typical risk neutral strategy, some measures that are
  presented are aiming to minimizing the impacts of the worst scenario in the
  network operation, and another additionally, takes into account different risk
  reduction profiles. Some computational experience is presented."
