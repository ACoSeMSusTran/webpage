abstract: There are presently several companies that provide processed or raw
  global positioning system (GPS) measurements generated by fleets of commercial
  vehicles, internet applications or automobile companies. The aim of this paper
  is to deepen our understanding of GPS data applicability in transportation
  modelling by providing systematic and quantified insights into the
  representativeness of collected data in describing individual’ route choices.
  Unfortunately, real data often contain noise, uncertainty, errors,
  redundancies or even irrelevant information. Useless models will be obtained
  when built over incorrect or incomplete data. This is why pre-processing is
  one of the most critical steps in data analysis. Yet, pre-processing has not
  been properly systematized, which is why this paper focuses on the necessary
  steps for pre-processing GPS tracking data together and puts forth a proposal
  for systematizing it. Furthermore, the aggregation level is at waypoint
  location for low latency GPS positions along the trip trajectory. Travel time
  reliability on OD paths is addressed, along with other OD path
  characteristics. Dense urban networks pose multiple possibilities for route
  choice, and data from new technologies offers an opportunity to understand
  route choice behaviour.
