abstract: The CitScale visualization and analytics platform has proven to be
  very practical in supporting the results analyses for different experimental
  designs. The designs applied here incorporated different traffic simulation
  models for various purposes. A project for probe vehicle data assessment has
  been incorporated into CitScale, as well as another project that focuses
  roughly on analyzing the impact of emissions in the Eixample on KPIs,
  specifically when the city shifts to more green modes such as bicycles or
  electric vehicles. A further development for improving demand modeling in
  CitScale will provide representations of activity -based demand. This flexible
  tool will save a lot of time for traffic analysts and future transportation
  projects at the UPC.
