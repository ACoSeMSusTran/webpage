summary: "The emergence of a variety of Machine Learning (ML) approaches for
  travel mode choice prediction poses an interesting question to transport
  modellers: which models should be used for which applications? The answer to
  this question goes beyond simple predictive performance, and is instead a
  balance of many factors, including behavioural interpretability and
  explainability, computational complexity, and data efficiency. There is a
  growing body of research which attempts to compare the predictive performance
  of different ML classifiers with classical Random Utility Models (RUMs).
  However, existing studies typically analyse only the disaggregate predictive
  performance, ignoring other aspects affecting model choice. Furthermore, many
  existing studies are affected by technical limitations, such as the use of
  inappropriate validation schemes, incorrect sampling for hierarchical data, a
  lack of external validation, and the exclusive use of discrete metrics. In
  this paper, we address these limitations by conducting a systematic comparison
  of different modelling approaches, across multiple modelling problems, in
  terms of the key factors likely to affect model choice (out-of-sample
  predictive performance, accuracy of predicted market shares, extraction of
  behavioural indicators, feature importance analysis, and computational
  efficiency). The modelling problems combine several real world datasets with
  synthetic datasets, where the data generation function is known. The results
  indicate that the models with the highest disaggregate predictive performance
  (namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forests (RF)) provide
  poorer estimates of behavioural indicators and aggregate mode shares, and are
  more expensive to estimate, than other models, including Deep Neural Networks
  (DNNs) and Multinomial Logit (MNL). It is further observed that the MNL model
  performs robustly in a variety of situations, though ML techniques can improve
  the estimates of behavioural indices such as Willingness To Pay (WTP)."
