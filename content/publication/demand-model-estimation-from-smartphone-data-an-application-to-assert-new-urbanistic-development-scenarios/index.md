abstract: "The pervasive use of mobile devices has brought a valuable new source
  of data. The work presented here has a twofold objective: firstly, to
  demonstrate the capability of mobile phone records to feed traditional
  trip-based demand models and, secondly, to assert the possibilities of using
  developed models to estimate the effects of new urbanistic development
  scenarios. Detailed trip data for the metropolitan area of Barcelona are
  reconstructed from mobile phone records. This information is then employed as
  input for building a set of demand trip-based models and to apply these
  daily-based models to the appraisal of new development scenarios in a VISUM
  model of the city. The model calibration and validation process proves the
  quality of the models obtained. Our results show the way in which the
  generated trips are distributed into the study area and modal share is
  modified in the considered scenarios."
