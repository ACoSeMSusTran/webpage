abstract = {The pervasive use of mobile devices has brought a valuable new source of data. The work presented here has a twofold objective: firstly, to demonstrate the capability of mobile phone records to feed traditional trip-based demand models and, secondly, to assert the possibilities of using developed models to estimate the effects of new urbanistic development scenarios. Detailed trip data for the metropolitan area of Barcelona are reconstructed from mobile phone records. This information is then employed as input for building a set of demand trip-based models and to apply these daily-based models to the appraisal of new development scenarios in a VISUM model of the city. The model calibration and validation process proves the quality of the models obtained. Our results show the way in which the generated trips are distributed into the study area and modal share is modified in the considered scenarios.}
