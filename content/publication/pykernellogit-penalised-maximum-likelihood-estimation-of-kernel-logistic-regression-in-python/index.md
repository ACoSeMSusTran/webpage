abstract: This paper presents a software package developed in Python that allows
  the application of the technique known as Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), a
  Machine Learning (ML) tool, to the problem of transport demand prediction.
  More concretely, it permits the specification of a series of models using KLR
  and their estimation by means of a Penalised Maximum Likelihood Estimation
  (PMLE) procedure providing a set of goodness-of-fit indicators and the
  application of model validation techniques. Another functionality is that it
  allows to extract from the model several indicators such as the Willingness to
  Pay (WTP) or the Value of Time (VOT).
