abstract: "Unexpected events may perturb operations and generate conflicts that
  must be addressed promptly to limit delay propagation and other negative
  impacts on the network. The real-time railway traffic management problem deals
  with disruptions in railway networks, including tracks, junctions and
  stations. When they happen in station areas, new decisions involving train
  platforming, rerouting, ordering and timing must be made in real time. This
  paper explores a mesoscopic approach to deal with disruptions at rail
  stations. A mathematical programming-based model is proposed to determine
  re-routing and re-scheduling decisions for railway traffic in a station area.
  The key steps of the approach, which simulate what happens in real-time
  traffic management, are: i) an initial off-line preprocessing stage of the set
  of feasible routes originally planned, ii) a second preprocessing stage which
  analyses the disruption and sets the necessary parameters for the last step
  iii), which consists of an integer programming model that seeks solutions
  which minimise deviations from planned train schedules and assigns new and
  appropriate platforms (if necessary). Computational experiments show that
  realistic instances can be solved near to optimality using CPLEX in very short
  times. This allows to consider this methodology for solving real time traffic
  management problems."
