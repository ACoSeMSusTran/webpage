abstract: When expanding an existing public transport system a common practice
  consists of defining a set of candidate new lines and from them, choose those
  that will revert into a greater increase of the system’s performance while
  keeping at a moderate level the associated amount of economical costs. In this
  work, a mathematical programming model for the selection of candidate lines in
  extensions of the public transport system is proposed based on the
  linearization of the model presented by Codina et al. (2013) and its
  application to situations of medium congestion. The model assumes that the
  pool of candidate lines is an input externally determined by technical
  criteria and it is focused in the compatibility constraints that the final set
  of selected lines must verify. These constraints include the overall
  throughput capacity of the stops/stations of the model, the availability of
  space for users to wait at stations, the resulting line capacities for
  passenger flows at line segments and the waiting times of passengers at stops.
  Solution procedures are based on the Cutting Plane’s algorithm and several
  small to medium size instances are successfully solved in the computational
  tests.
