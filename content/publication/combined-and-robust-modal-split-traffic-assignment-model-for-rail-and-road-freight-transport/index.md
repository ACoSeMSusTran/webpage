abstract: This paper expands on the stochastic version of the strategy-based
  congested transit assignment problem described in Codina and Rosell (2017b),
  specifically by extending it to cases dealing with explicit line capacities.
  Following this previous work, the stochastic model with explicit line
  capacities takes into account the stochastic mean waiting times and in-vehicle
  travel times of passengers at stops during the standard scenario journey of
  the planning period. This slightly modified model is formulated also as a
  stochastic variational inequality derived from the deterministic version of
  the problem with similar properties and characteristics, formulated by the
  authors in a previous work. For this stochastic capacitated model, two
  algorithms are presented which may take advantage of simplified simulation
  models for the bus stops in order to provide realistic mean waiting times for
  passengers at stops. Both algorithms can be easily adapted to the case of the
  model with non-strict capacities by Codina and Rosell (2017b).
