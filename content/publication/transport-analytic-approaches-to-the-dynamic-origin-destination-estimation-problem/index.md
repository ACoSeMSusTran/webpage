abstract: Dynamic traffic models require dynamic inputs, one of the main ones
  being the Dynamic Origin–Destinations (OD) matrices describing the variability
  over time of the trip patterns across the network. The Dynamic OD Matrix
  Estimation (DODME) is a challenging problem since no direct observations are
  available, and therefore one should resort to indirect estimation approaches.
  Among the most efficient approaches, the one that formulates the problem in
  terms of a bi-level optimization problem has been widely used. This
  formulation solves at the upper level a nonlinear optimization problem that
  minimizes some distance measures between observed and estimated link flow
  counts at certain counting stations located in a subset of links in the
  network, and at the lower level a traffic assignment that estimates these link
  flow counts assigning the current estimated matrix. The variants of this
  formulation differ in the analytical approaches that estimate the link flows
  in terms of the traffic assignment and their time dependencies. Since these
  estimations are based on a traffic assignment at the lower level, these
  analytical approaches, although numerically efficient, imply a high
  computational cost. The advent of ICT applications has made available new sets
  of traffic-related measurements enabling new approaches; under certain
  conditions, the data collected allows to estimate the most likely used paths,
  from which a de facto assignment matrix can be computed. This allows
  extracting empirically similar information to that provided by the dynamic
  traffic assignment that is used in the analytical approaches. This paper
  explores how to extract such information from the recorded commercial data,
  proposes a new constrained non-linear optimization model to solve the DODME
  problem, with a reduced number of variables linearly depending on network size
  instead of quadratically. Moreover, the bilevel iterative process and the
  traffic assignment need are avoided. Validation and computational results on
  its performance are presented.
