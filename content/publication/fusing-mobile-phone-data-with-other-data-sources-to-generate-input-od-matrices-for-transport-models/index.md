abstract: OD matrices that describe mobility patterns provide major input to
  most transport analysis models. Since OD matrices are not yet directly
  observable, they are usually estimated indirectly. Data from new sources such
  as mobile phone records and GPS traces from mobile apps are emerging
  alternatives that allow for cheaper and timely estimates. However, they are
  still hindered by weaknesses that must be studied for use as input to
  transportation models. This paper presents a case study using mobility data
  from mobile phone records, with the goal of establishing a methodology for
  validating the obtained OD matrices and generating the appropriate input for
  traffic assignment models. Spatial and temporal consistency of OD data
  elaborated from mobile records has been proved to be useful for transportation
  modelling needs.
