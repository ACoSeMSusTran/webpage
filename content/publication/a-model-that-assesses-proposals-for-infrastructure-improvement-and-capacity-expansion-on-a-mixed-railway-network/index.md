abstract: This paper presents a mathematical programming-based model for
  evaluating the impact on a mixed railway network from proposals for
  infrastructure improvement and capacity expansion that are oriented mainly
  toward increasing freight transportation. The authors have applied this model
  to extend elements of an existing mixed railway network, perform relatively
  less costly actions on the network, and to enhance capacity by adding new
  blocking/control systems at specific locations. These aspects are usually not
  taken into account in models for regional planning. Rather than a model whose
  sole focus is on railway capacity expansion, our approach combines
  capacity-expansion with network design. Because the way investments generate
  returns to the freight transportation system is of utmost relevance for these
  types of problems, this model is based on the efficient frontier between
  investment and operating costs. The model is tested on a regional network in
  the Mediterranean Corridor.
