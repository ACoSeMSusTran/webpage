**Abstract:**

This Coordinated Project is composed of 8 different specific objectives.

* **O1 UPC-URJC-UCLM.** *Modelling of competition between operators using static Nash Equilibrium models. Analysis of access charges policies under regular and extreme scenarios.* Infrastructure Managers (IMs), such as the Spanish *ADIF Alta Velocidad* (passengers) and ADIF (passengers and freight), usually aim to recover the costs of the infrastructure from the transport operators.
* **O3 UPC-UCLM.**  *Modelling the time slot allocation by the Infrastructure Manager (IM) in deregulated markets in both normal and low demand scenarios.*
* **O4 URJC-UCLM.** *Combining operations research methods, machine learning and artificial intelligence to advance the theory and practice of operational transportation system planning and management in competitive scenarios.*
* **O7 UCLM.** *Design of machine learning methods and artificial intelligence for the tactical analysis of the competition in transport systems..*
* **O8 UPC-URJC-UCLM.** *Dissemination, internationalization, strategy, and coordination of the project.*
