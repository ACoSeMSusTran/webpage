**Abstract:**

The objectives of this subproject are:

* **01 UPC-URJC-UCLM**. Modelling of competition between operators using static Nash Equilibrium models. Analysis of access charges policies under regular and extreme scenarios.
* **02 UPC-URJC**. Strategic planning of fleets and routes in multimodal enviroments in competitios and under highly variable settings.
* **03 UPC-UCLM**. Modelling the time slot allocation by the Infrastructure manager in deregulated markets in both normal and low demand scenarios.
* **05 UPC**. Activity-based models for uncertain and estricted demand situations for urban and interurban mobility.
