Dr MªPaz Linares got her Degree in Mathematics from the UPC in 2005. She completed a Master of Logistics, Transportation and Mobility also by the UPC in 2008, with a final project dedicated to Vehicle Routing Problem incorporating backhaul customers. In 2014, she held her PhD in Statistics and Operations Research at UPC in dynamic traffic assignment based on mesoscopic traffic simulation.
In 2004, she was collaborating in the IRI (UPC-CSIC) on projects related to industrial optimization solved by simulation. Since 2005, she has been working at UPC on R+D projects specialized in applying optimization and simulation techniques to transportation problems. From 2010 to 2013, she collaborated with CENIT (Center for Innovation in Transport)  on projects related to smart cities.
Since 2008, she is an assistant professor at the Department of Statistics and Operation Research at UPC, and also, is collaborating at inLab FIB UPC in the Smart Mobility group, working on projects related to dynamic traffic models: developing simulation models and using them to optimize transport and traffic problems.
