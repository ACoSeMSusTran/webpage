Lídia Montero has been an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research at the UPC since 1998. In 1985 she began collaborating with LIOS (Laboratory of Operational Research and Simulation), which merged with other UPC research groups in 1997 to create PROMALS (Mathematical Programming, Logistics and Simulation), an already consolidated research group. In January 2014, she joined the CIT-UPC from the IMP  research group (Information Modeling and Processing), certified by the Catalan government since 2014 (AGAUR). 

She has experience in transportation and mobility consulting at AGL (Advanced Logistics Group) in international projects financed by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (BID).

Her research focuses on demand modelling and transport and mobility analytics. She was a founding partner of TSS (currently AIMSUN), a UPC spin-off company for the commercialization of the AIMSUN microscopic simulator. She has actively investigated transit models and microscopic simulation by participating as a partner in projects within the national and European Union R&D&I programs. She has presented around 100 communications at scientific congresses.
