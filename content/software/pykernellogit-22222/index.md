### What is PyKernelLogit
PyKernelLogit is a Python package for performing maximum likelihood estimation
of conditional logit models and similar discrete choice models based on the
Python package PyLogit. This package extends the functionalities of PyLogit to
provide some functionalities that allows to estimate discrete choice models
based on Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR). Moreover, this package provides some
functions to estimate indicators such as the Willingness to Pay (WTP) for the
KLR models.
