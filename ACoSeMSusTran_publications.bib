  abstract  = {The present work addresses the problem of community detection in social networks. Determination of the community structure permits to identify the organizational and functional units of the network. To such an end, the most powerful approach is the fuzzy one. Here, each network node participates in all the communities simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a general formalism for fuzzy community detection in weighted, unweighted, directed and undirected social networks. Using an error functional measuring the difference between the predicted and observed network topologies, the problem is transformed into an unconstrained minimization. This allows to define a general algorithmic pattern based on the greedy paradigm, which can be customized to several different fuzzy community detection algorithms. Analysis of the algorithmic complexity of the procedure permits to determine the factors responsible for the variation of its running time. Using this information, we define an efficient algorithm (TRIBUNE) by applying a conjugate gradient approach. To determine the performance of TRIBUNE, we introduce a new network model specially designed as a fuzzy community detection benchmark. Using this benchmark, we show that TRIBUNE greatly reduces the dependence on the number of iterations of the optimization procedure. As a result, TRIBUNE needs in average 84% less time than the steepest descent baseline to solve a test set of benchmark networks. Furthermore, the performance of TRIBUNE increases with the network size.},

  abstract = {Several common general purpose optimization algorithms are compared for finding A- and D-optimal designs for different types of statistical models of varying complexity, including high dimensional models with five and more factors. The algorithms of interest include exact methods, such as the interior point method, the Nelder–Mead method, the active set method, the sequential quadratic programming, and metaheuristic algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Several simulations are performed, which provide general recommendations on the utility and performance of each method, including hybridized versions of metaheuristic algorithms for finding optimal experimental designs. A key result is that general-purpose optimization algorithms, both exact methods and metaheuristic algorithms, perform well for finding optimal approximate experimental designs.},

  abstract  = {The success of machine-learning methods is spreading their use to many different fields. This paper analyses one of these methods, the Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), from the point of view of Random Utility Model (RUM) and proposes the use of the KLR to specify the utilities in RUM, freeing the modeler from the need to postulate a functional relation between the features. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to empirically compare KLR with the Multinomial Logit (MNL) method, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Random Forests (RF). We have shown that, using simulated data, KLR is the only method that achieves maximum accuracy and leads to an unbiased willingness-to-pay estimator for non-linear phenomena. In a real travel mode choice problem, RF achieved the highest predictive accuracy, followed by KLR. However, KLR allows for the calculation of indicators such as the value of time, which is of great importance in the context of transportation. },

  abstract  = {In the last few years, the success of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has led to the extension of their applications to areas such as transport planning. One of the main tasks within transport planning is the analysis of transport demand. To do so, it is necessary to analyse the way in which users make their decisions about the trips they make and, therefore, be able to predict the number of passengers on the transport network in relation to respect to interventions made on the transport system. Consequently, transport policies and plans can be evaluated according to the behaviour of the passengers. Discrete choice models based on random utility maximization have been developed over the last four decades, becoming the canonical tool for transport demand analysis. Nowadays, the use of ML methods could provide an alternative to discrete choice models, as they reduce the need for the analyst to specify the functional expression of these models and achieve a higher level of accuracy in their predictions. A Python software package called PyKernelLogit was developed to apply a ML method called Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) to the problem of predicting the transport demand. This package allows the user to specify a set of models using KLR and the estimation of those using a Penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure. Moreover, this tool also provides a set of indicators for goodness of fit and the application of model validation techniques. Finally, it allows to obtain the willingness to pay or value of time indicators commonly used in transport planning.},

  abstract = {Dynamic traffic management (DTM) systems are used to reduce the negative externalities of traffic congestion, such as air pollution in urban areas. They require traffic and environmental monitoring infrastructures. In this paper we present a prototype of a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) system for monitoring traffic flow and the Air Quality Index (AQI). The computation of the traffic flows is based on processing video in the compressed domain. Only using motion vectors as input, traffic flow is computed in real-time over an embedded architecture. An estimation of the AQI is supported by machine learning regression techniques, using different feature data obtained from the IoT device. These automatic learning techniques overcome the need for complex calibration and other limitations of embedded devices in making the needed measurements of the pollutant gases for the computation of the actual AQI. The experimentation with the data obtained from different cities representing different scenarios with a variety of climate and traffic conditions, allows validating the proposed architecture. As regressors, Linear Regression (LR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Random Forest (RF) are compared using the performance metrics R2, MSE, MAE and MRE resulting in a relevant improvement of the AQI estimations of our proposal.},
